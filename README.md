# Project 2 Generative Audio

Caleb Kirilov, ckirilov2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

I plan to showcase the utility of machine learning tools for songwriting. 

My song "I Was The One" will be sung by an AI vocal clone of Elliot Smith, chord progression styles of Multitrack VAE, and a bridge from AI Jukebox generated with the constraints of "Grunge", "The Strokes", and my lyrics.

## Model/Data

The models and data used:
- AI Vocal Clone
- AI Jukebox
- Multitrack VAE
- Magenta Piano Genie

## Code

Code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:


## Technical Notes

I wouldn't reccomend using the generative_code.ipynb notebook without a subscription to Google Collab. Generation requires significant power.

## Reference

This was a great reference for my project. His blog includes links to databases for AI Jukebox and instructions.
